						<h1>Why Rush?</h1>
					</header>
					<br>
					<h3>Professional Growth</h3>
					<p>When students enter college, they realize the importance of professionalism. As students further their college career, they will meet people with many different backgrounds. Professionalism will play a big role in meeting and working with different people. Joining Greek Life will give students exposure to a diverse group of people. Greek-Letter Organizations understand the importance of building relationships with students who have different backgrounds and cultures. Professionalism will be a growing process in anyone’s life, so rushing a fraternity will boost your professional growth in our diverse world.</p>
					<h3>Networking for Jobs</h3>
					<p>Greek-Letter Organizations have growing alumni who mentor and provide opportunities to active members. Greek members who graduate college will have the networking advantage when compared to their counterparts entering the job market. Alumni connections are a great tool for career development and help one gain soft and technical skills. Active members will be presented with an opportunity to approach alumni who give insight into the professional world. Networking is a crucial skill to gain for achieving career success.</p>
					<h3>Making Everlasting Relationships</h3>
					<p>Rushing a fraternity will build connections that will last a lifetime. Greek-Letter organizations are made up of individuals who are unique from one another but are united with a common spirit. Members of each chapter share experiences, ideas, and opportunities. Sharing experiences in college together build bonds, which provides support to members who are transitioning into adulthood. Sharing experiences and common goals will make members more knowledgeable about life on campus.</p>
					<h3>Active Service</h3>
					<p>Greek-Letter Organizations take pride in serving their community. Fraternity members are required to volunteer in their communities. Organizations believe the act of public service builds leadership skills in each and every member. Gaining leadership skills will transpire an individual’s life in many positive ways. Through volunteering, members gauge the well-being of their community. Helping people who are less fortunate builds gratitude and instill values in members who volunteer.</p>
					<h3>Build Your Legacy</h3>
					<p>As you enter college and leave behind the teens, it will become important to make connections, gain knowledge, and step out of your comfort zone. Understand that you are entering one of the most exciting chapters of your life; the college experience will be the foundation of your legacy. Your legacy will separate you from being an average bystander with someone who people want to remember. Your interactions on the college campus and positive changes you bring to your organization will leave on impact for others to admire. Moving your organization in a positive direction and active participation on campus will help build your legacy.</p>

					<h1>FAQs</h1>
					<br>
					<h3>What is Rush?</h3>
					<p>Greek organizations practice what is called either Recruitment or Intake. There are two forms of recruitment, formal and informal. Formal recruitment consists of a “Rush Week” where each chapter will host a series of events for potential new members. The formal process allows you to experience the brotherhood and various activities we engage in. However, throughout the remainder of the calendar year, all young men will have the opportunity to meet and interact with our fraternity members (informal recruitment). The Membership Intake process to join occurs at various times throughout the year at the discretion of each chapter, in accordance with university policies, rules, and regulations.</p>
					<h3>What is the financial obligation?</h3>
					<p>Like some opportunities for involvement in college, there is a financial commitment associated with a joining a fraternity or sorority. The costs go toward the national fees, chapter operating expenses, and social functions. Financial obligations differ among individual chapters, as well as living in or out of a chapter house. Typically, these consist of chapter dues, national dues, and philanthropy dues. We understand the strain these unexpected expenses can cause on students and/or parents so we offer options such as payment plans and fundraising opportunities to help.</p>
					<h3>What is a bid and what if I don't get one this semester?</h3>
					<p>The bid is an invitation to join a fraternity. Bids are given out through an exclusive fashion to certain members who attend rush events. If you weren't given a bid this semester, no worries, you would be invited to the rush events the following semester.</p>
					<h3>What are the benefits of becoming a brother?</h3>
					<p>AIO has been around for 21 years. Throughout that time, we have had nine chapters develop in the United States and one chapter in Canada, which individually have had numerous brothers pass through. As a member of AIO, you are not only part of the brotherhood locally but are part of this larger group of members, both current and past. Our Alumni actively pass down knowledge, traditions and strive to provide opportunities.</p>
