						<h1>History</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Alpha Iota Omicron was founded at the University of Michigan on October 16, 1998 by 18 young men with a singular vision. These young men sought to establish a South Asian social fraternity based on the fundamental principles of Brotherhood, Networking, Community Service, and Cultural Competence. 
</p><p>Alpha Iota Omicron is a fraternity dedicated to providing males the means for success in a changing global society. The Brothers of Alpha Iota Omicron help men turn into leaders, ready to make a difference in the world.</p><p>Alpha Iota Omicron has risen over the past 21 years as the leading South Asian fraternity in the midwest along with being a nationally recognized symbol of professionalism and excellence. Through our expansion efforts over the years, we have established 10 chapters at leading universities across the nation. From philanthropy and fundraising efforts to social and professional events, Alpha Iota Omicron strives to be at the forefront of society, dedicated to providing its members with the right tools to excel in life.</p><p>Alpha Iota Omicron Zeta Chapter was founded in 2014 by our six founding fathers, Kevin Gopal, Manu Kurian, Anad Revanam, Premal Desai, Jahnu Reddy, and Tej Sura. Initially, AIO was a part of the Multi- Cultural Greek Council at Saint Louis University, however in 2019, the chapter transitioned into the InterFraternity Council. Throughout the years, AIO has changed and evolved into the chapter it is today. Our brothers have stood by our ideals of Philanthropy, Cultural Competency, Networking, and Brotherhood by hosting on-campus events and developing relationships within the community. AIO hosts annual events such as sparklers for Diwali, our end of the year formal, and an annual philanthropy week to promote awareness for the National Down Syndrome Society.</p>

					<h1>Our Pillars</h1>
					<br>
					<h3>Brotherhood</h3>
					<p>Brothers of Alpha Iota Omicron become part of the organization for life. They know they can constantly rely on their peers and lifelong brothers for help in academic, social, and professional matters. Alpha Iota Omicron bases its values on the idea of unity and representing ourselves as ONE. We are all one and represent each other. We support each other in any endeavor one chooses. Older brothers serve as mentors to younger members, imparting essential knowledge to benefit the professional success of younger members. AIO provides mentorship and guidance throughout our members' academic career as well as after in a professional setting. </p>
					<h3>Networking</h3>
					<p>Alpha Iota Omicron helps build strong relationships within our fraternity. Many of our brothers have gone on to be extremely successful in the professional world. We help our current members connect with alumni, strengthening our overall network. Strong relationships in any scenario are crucial to accomplishing an organization or a person’s ambitions. Learning to network with all races, cultures, and organizations provides the vehicle to achieve those relationships. Being able to interact and relate with diverse groups of people gives a brother a broad spectrum on the professional world. Networking creates opportunities and AIO prides itself on the relationships it has created internally as well as externally with numerous local, national, and global organizations. It is our collaboration with these entities that provides us with a broad scope of involvement and is essential to the diversity we strive for.</p>
					<h3>Community Service</h3>
					<p>The founders of AIO believed that as citizens and residents of the land of opportunity it is our job to help those who are not as lucky. Helping those who are not as blessed as our own brothers, people who do not have the ability to attend college or better their lives, individuals who, through birth have been systemically diminished in confidence and character. Alpha Iota Omicron works to bring the attention of not only the brothers, by all those that can help, to focus on the problems in society as well as problems that plague the world. By giving back to the community and campus we are not only contributing but also raising awareness for various causes and organizations. Leading by example, AIO strives to organize and execute community service events to show our appreciation and dedication for others. Every little act helps, and AIO, thru its brothers strives to make a difference.​</p>
					<h3>Cultural Competence</h3>
					<p>Alpha Iota Omicron has a rich history of the promotion of South Asian Culture. From hosting Garba events, to hosting South Asian film festivals, from helping create South Asian forums, to winning awards at such South Asian events as SASA; Alpha Iota Omicron has always worked to promote the culture of the South Asian sub-continent. The reason AIO does this is to add to the diversity of society as well as increase awareness of our uniquity. By promoting South Asian culture we also work to learn about all the other cultures of the world. This cultural exchange works to both help and unite our community and our fraternity.</p>

				<h1>Philanthropy</h1>
				<p>To uphold our pillar of Philanthropy, brothers engage in activities throughout St. Louis to help those in need. Brothers volunteer with Labre to help support the homeless population of St. Louis, work with nearby hospitals to provide assistance, and host an annual philanthropy week. During this week, brothers plan and promote events such as Pie a Brother and collect donations for the National Down Syndrome Society. Our goal is to give back to the community in any way we can. Come join us and support our community at our upcoming events!</p>
